Learning python and data sciecne to try and create data driven education, I also post some of my passion projects on here to find statistical insight about some of my hobbies.
Currently, enrolled in a data science bootcamp after teaching myself data analytics for a year.
I am intrested in NLP, deep learning and how these models can help education.
